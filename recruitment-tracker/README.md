# **Recruitment Tracker**
This is an application built using FastAPI, Typer, SQLAlchemy's Query API, and Python to help recruiters keep a track of their applicants and the tasks assigned to said applicants. It offers a web user interface alongside a command line interface to make the task of managing applicants as easy as possible.

# **QuickStart**
To begin, you should navigate towards the recruitment-tracker directory using the following command:
```
cd [path-to-recruiting-assessment-tracker-directory]/recruitment-tracker
```
You can either create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or you can globally install the dependencies for this application
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And you're done!

# **Models**
The data is stored in a SQL database and this application stores information into 2 tables: **Applicant And AdditionalInfo**    
The ***Applicant*** table takes the following fields:  
```
1. netid -> Applicant's Unique Identifier (String, used as primary key in this table)
2. name -> Applicant's Name (String)
3. email -> Applicant's email (String
4. year -> Applicant's Educational Standing (Freshmen, Senior, etc.) (String)
5. major -> Applicant's Major (String)
6. smajor -> Applicant's Second Major (String, defaulted to an empty string)
7. teams -> The Team Being Applied To (String)
8. minor -> Applicant's Minor (String, defaulted to an empty string)
9. sminor -> Applicant's Second Minor (String, defaulted to empty string)
10. task_id -> The Assignment Assigned To This Applicant (Integer, foreign key)
11. selected -> Whether or Not the Applicant Has Been Selected (Boolean, defaulted to false)
12. comments -> Comments on The Applicant (String, defaulted to empty string)
```

The ***AdditionalInfo*** table takes the following fields:  
```
1. id -> Assignment ID (Integer, used as primary key in this table)
2. assignment_no -> Assignment Number (String)
3. team_assigned -> The Team This Assignment Corresponds To (String)
4. date_given -> The Date This Assignment Was Assigned (datetime.date Object)
5. date_due -> The Date This Assignment Is Due (datetime.date Object)
6. submitted -> Has This Task Been Turned In? (Boolean, defaulted to false)
7. assignment_comments -> Comment's on This Assignment (String, defaulted to empty string)
```

# **Usage**
You can use this application in either a web interface mode or command line mode
# Web Interface
Thanks to uvicorn, you can get a local webserver up and running using the following command:  
```
uvicorn [path-to-applicant-directory].main:app 
```
or if you've opened the `recruitment-tracker` directory in the terminal, you can just run the following command:  
```
uvicorn applicant.main:app
```
The server will start running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
To make it easier to access all endpoints, use the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` address (FastAPI provides this documentation by default!)  
After that, you will be able to run the following endpoints: 
```
GET /applicant (returns all the applicants)

POST /applicant Create (creates an applicant)

GET /applicant/{netid} (returns applicant by netid)

PUT /applicant/{netid} (updates an applicant by their netid) (allows you to update everything about the applicant)

DELETE /applicant/{netid} (deletes an applicant by their netid)

POST /assignment (creates an assignment)

GET /assignment/{id} (get assignment by id)

PUT /assignment/{id} (updates an assignment by id) (allows you to update everything about the assignment)

GET /assignments/{no} (returns all assignments sharing the same assignment number)
```
***Make sure to first create an assignment to give to an applicant***

# Command Line Interface
Thanks to Typer, you can easily pass command line arguments. A general way to run the command is:  
```
python3 [path-to-cli.py] [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]....
```
if you've accessed the `recruitment-tracker` directory, then you can run:
```
python3 cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]....
```
###### Commands
`Usage: cli.py init [OPTIONS] FILE_ASSIGNMENT FILE_SUBMISSION`

Arguments:
  FILE_ASSIGNMENT  [required]
  FILE_SUBMISSION  [required]
  
`Example: python3 cli.py init example_assignment.csv example_submission.csv`  
Populates the tables depending on the passed csv files (Make sure to pass the assignments file first)  
***WARNING: This command overwrites the tables***  
  
`Usage: cli.py overview [OPTIONS]`

Options:
  --output-to-file / --no-output-to-file
                                  [default: no-output-to-file]

`Example: python3 cli.py overview --output-to-file` => returns applicants who have done the assignment, haven't done the assignment, are overdue on their assignment, and returns this all in an `output.txt` file if the optional parameter is passed

`Usage: cli.py search [OPTIONS] NETID`

Arguments:
  NETID  [required]
  
`Example: python3 cli.py search person0` => returns an applicant with the provided netid, if he/she exists

# Why FastAPI?
- It is a modern framework that allows developers to build API seamlessly without much effort and time. It is much faster than the traditional flask approach because itâ€™s built over ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) instead of WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface). You can get more information on ASGI vs WSGI [Here.](https://www.programmersought.com/article/60453596349/)
- While Flask and Django have limited async support, FastAPI has enabled asynchronous endpoint support by default.
- Uses SwaggerUI and ReDoc to automatically document endpoints. This allows developers to focus on the code instead of downloading a bunch of random tools.
- FastAPI makes use of Python 3.6 type declarations, this means that it uses a Python feature that allows you to specify the type of a variable, and this framework makes extensive use out of it - providing developers with great editor support. Autocompletion also works with VSCode!
- It also provides suport for OAuth2 (JWT Tokens), API Keys, headers and query parameters.
We've also used uvicorn here as uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation.

# Future Improvements
- Adding support for more commands
- Refactoring all applicant and assignment endpoints into API routers to make maintaining the code easier
- Adding some sort of functionality to automatically email selected applicants a message through the command line interface
- Create a frontend to make the interface more user friendly
- Expose this script as an API
- Adding multiple language support
- Creating a login system for both recruiters and applicants to facilitate better communication
